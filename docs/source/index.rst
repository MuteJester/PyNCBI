Welcome to PyNCBI's documentation!
===================================

**PyNCBI** is a Python library for fast and easy integration with NCBI and for working with methylation data.

When working with methylation data, NCBI might be one of the most extensive open source databases that provide the methylation data and the information around it. When working with NCBI on a day-to-day basis, searching, querying, and extracting information may prove to be a time-consuming and headache-producing challenge. PyNCBI strives to answer all needs a researcher might need when communicating with NCBI using a straightforward python API that allows to quickly test, extract, analyze and download relevant data.
